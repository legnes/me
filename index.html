      I wanted to see if I could fold paper with webgl/threejs. A simple edge detection algorithm tracks creases. They get a cheap gaussian blur (using linear filtering) before getting layered on top of previous folds and the base texture.

      Checkerboard is a threejs/webgl take on a doodle I've done since I was a kid (it looked kind of like this):

        <img class="image-medium" src="assets/check2.jpg"/>

      Initially conceived as an excuse to play with full-screen quads + frag shaders, Checkerboard grew into a small-scale particle system driven by a physical simulation running on the gpu. I had a blast working out a Runge-Kutta integrator and some simple lens optics!

      I built Jueves for the Global Game Jam 2017. It's an expansion and variation on <a href="https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_gpgpu_water">an existing threejs demo</a>. No small part of the ~40 hours jamming time went towards creating the canvas/key control scheme and tuning the simulation for gameplay (there was a nasty energy leak from the input model). I stuck with pretty simple shader logic but I ended up happy with the look!

      Ethan Edwards and I collaborated on Robotanical for ProcJam 2016, although busy schedules left it in a somewhat unfinished state. The idea was to cultivate a virtual garden of plants grown by Lindenmayer systems and parsed into svg by a turtle renderer. The version here demonstrates the core functionality by implementing a few well-known L-systems.

      Walk is an animation/experiment that attempts to fill a discretized grid by propagating a random(ish), non-self-intersecting path through it. Since the odds against that are pretty high, Walk is more like a movie of a computer painting itself into a corner over and over. Try changing the step pattern!

      I should probably explain the controls to you now. When I made Phenomenol back in 2014, I wanted it to be a sort of 3d line rider. There are two third-person points of view from which you can draw platforms in the space (mouse to draw, z to toggle pov). While in this drawing mode, you can control (using wasd) a marker that determines how far away from the camera the platforms will be placed. The idea is to place platforms so that the first-person character (wasd + mouse) can, by traversing them, collect the spinning cubes around the level. If you run out of platforms, don't worry; in first-person mode you can shoot (lmb) projectiles to collect/recall them. Last thing: those blue boxes on the ground in each corner will launch you into the air, which can be helpful. Phenomenol came out a tedious and unforgiving game, but if you approach it with patience it ~can~ be (strangely) compelling.
      NB: Phenomenol was original made in a much older version of unity, and rebuilding it for the post-flash era introduced some strangeness. Then again, it was pretty strange to begin with...

      For the Global Game Jam 2014, I teamed up with Ethan Edwards to make EPR&D. There's always a theme for GGJ and in 2014 it was something about what we see not being what really is or...I don't remember. But I'd had this idea in my head for a while about a game whose mechanic only works when you can't see it work, and we decided to go with that.
      NB: This is a rebuild of an old unity project and as such may have even more bugs than it did originally.

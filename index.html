      Checkerboard is a threejs/webgl take on a doodle I've done since I was a kid. Initially conceived as an excuse to play with full-screen quads + frag shaders, Checkerboard grew into a small-scale particle system driven by a physical simulation running on the gpu. I had a blast working out a Runge-Kutta integrator and some simple lens optics (although I should probably find someone to check my math)!

      I built Jueves for the Global Game Jam 2017. It's an expansion and variation on <a href="">an existing threejs demo</a>. The bulk of the ~40 hours alotted went towards coming up with the canvas/key input scheme and tuning the simulation and input for gameplay (there was a nasty energy leak from the input system). I was surprised that play testers had an overwhelmingly positive reaction to the "asthetic", since the shader logic is all very simple!

      Ethan Edwards and I collaborated on Robotanical for ProcJam2016, although busy schedules left it in a somewhat unfinished state. The idea was to cultivate an svg garden filled with plants grown by Lindenmayer systems and parsed into svg by a turtle renderer. The version here demonstrates the core functionality by implementing a few well-known L-systems.

      Walk is a simulation/animation aimed at the question: "can we use Monte Carlo methods to reliably fill a discretely subdivided space with one single, randomly-generated closed path?" Also: "how does the mode of propagation of the path affect success/failure?" The implementation here indicates two clear answers: "no", and "not much." But it's kind of hypnotizing anyway.

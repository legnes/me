      Sometimes I say: "doodling helps me think". Or: "it keeps my hands busy". Does that really explain anything? Truth be told I don't know why I do it, but then again anyone would be hard pressed to come up with a plausible motivation when they notice they've spent the last half an hour filling in the enclosed sections of every a, b, d, g, o, p, q, and R on a page. I have a few go-to doodles, mostly lettering and patterns. One of them consists of closed shapes superimposed on a checkerboard. The "phase" of the checkerboard pattern (i.e. whether the, say, top left square is black or white) flips across the boundaries defined by the shapes. "Checkerboard" is a webgl take on that doodle. Initially conceived as an excuse to play with full-screen quads, "Checkerboard" grew into a small-scale particle system driven by a physical simulation running on the gpu. The trickiest subsystem to write was probably collision response -- the implementation here is a little hackier than I'd like. I had a blast working out the Runge-Kutta integration and lens optics, but nobody's checked my math, so they could be totally wrong!

      Ethan Edwards and I collaborated on Robotanical for ProcJam2016. It was conceived as an svg garden filled with plants. Each plant would be its own Lindenmayer system, drawn by a turtle and parsed into svg. The garden only reached a prototypical stage before wilting away.

      Jueves was built for the Global Game Jam 2017. It was based on an existing threejs demo. I had some difficulty coming up with an input scheme that I could feed intuitively into the gpu simulation, but I ended up very pleased with the canvas/key system. The frag shader was sort of a random heuristic, but when I demoed the game, almost everyone commented on its "unique asthetic"...Other fun things in this project included fine-tuning the simulation physics for playability and a questionable use of gpu readback!

      Walk is the start of a simulation/animation aimed at the question: Can we use Monte Carlo methods to reliably fill a discretely subdivided space with one single, randomly-generated closed path? Also: How does the mode of propagation of the path affect success/failure? (Note: the method attempted here largely fails to complete the challenge.)
